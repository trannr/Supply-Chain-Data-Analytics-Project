# Supply-Chain-Data-Analytics-Dashboard
This is an end-to-end supply chain analysis project using SQL and a Kaggle dataset. I explored sales trends, supplier performance, shipping costs, product quality, profitability, and inventory levels, then brought the findings together in interactive dashboards.


Objectives
1. Identify top-selling products and their contribution to total revenue.
2. Evaluate supplier performance and delivery consistency.
3. Analyze shipping costs by carrier and route.
4. Investigate quality issues and defect rate trends.
5. Calculate product profitability and margins.
6. Recommend inventory optimization strategies.
